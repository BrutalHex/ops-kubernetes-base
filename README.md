# Introduction

The `ops-kubernetes-base` project is responsible for configuring resources inside `Kubernetes`.  
It sets up essential workloads in EKS, including ArgoCD, Cert-Manager, and other foundational components.  

For more details, refer to the [ops-infra](https://github.com/BrutalHex/ops-infra) repository.  

## Setup
To initiate the configuration process, push your changes and trigger the [setup action](https://github.com/BrutalHex/ops-kubernetes-base/actions/workflows/setup.yaml).  

## Destroy
To destroy the resources, trigger the [destroy action](https://github.com/BrutalHex/ops-kubernetes-base/actions/workflows/destroy.yaml).
